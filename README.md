This folder includes early research and small proof-of-concept projects exploring human-AI (primarily LLM) interactions. As of November 2025, it includes two projects:

## Projects

### (1) relational-health-dashboard
Tracking relational health patterns in AI interactions through privacy-preserving usage metrics. Early work toward a monitoring dashboard for understanding conversational dynamics.

### (2) personalized-context-rag
